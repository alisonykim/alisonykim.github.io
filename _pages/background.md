<!-- Bio -->

<p>
I am a recent Master's graduate in Digital Linguistics and a research assistant for <a href="https://www.ius.uzh.ch/de/staff/professorships/alphabetical/hermstruewer/team/person.html" target="_blank">Yoan Hermstrüwer</a> at the UZH Faculty of Law. At the moment, my projects center on applications of NLU to law and legal technology.<br><br>

Originally, I have a background in physics, neuroscience, and clinical psychology. I consider my experiences across domains, countries, and languages as assets to my interdisciplinary work.<br><br>

Before moving to Switzerland, I grew up in Los Angeles and spent about a decade in the San Francisco Bay Area. I miss the tacos and beaches of California, but have grown to enjoy rösti and Swiss rivers, especially the Aare. Additionally, I'm an enormous fan of the SBB/CFF/FFS and can occasionally be found reading or coding in my "train office" (see below: Geneva-Zurich route along Lac Leman).<br><br>

Lastly, I view foreign language learning as a fun and humbling hobby that also positively impacts my work as a computational linguist. My active target languages at the moment are <em>Nederlands</em> (Dutch) and <em>Suomi</em> (Finnish).<br>
