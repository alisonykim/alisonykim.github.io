<!-- Bio -->

<p>
I recently completed my Master's in Digital Linguistics at the University of Zurich, where I gained theoretical knowledge and practical skills in computational linguistics (CL) and natural language processing/generation (NLP/NLG). Originally, I have a background in physics, neuroscience, and clinical psychology. I view my experiences across domains, cities, countries, and languages as assets to my work in language technology.<br><br>

Before moving to Switzerland, I grew up in Los Angeles and spent about a decade in the San Francisco Bay Area. I miss the tacos and beaches of California, but have grown to enjoy r√∂sti and Swiss rivers, especially the Aare. Also, I'm an enormous fan of the SBB/CFF/FFS and can occasionally be found reading or coding in my "train office" (pictured below on the Geneva-Zurich route along Lac Leman).<br><br>

Lastly, as a computational linguist, I think foreign language learning is valuable, humbling, and fun. My target languages at the moment are Nederlands (Dutch) and Suomi (Finnish).
