Hi!<br>

I recently finished the first year of my M.A. in (Digital) Linguistics at the University of Zurich. Currently, I'm part of a team working on <a href="https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en/texttechnologies/research/opinionmining/sentiment-inference.html" target="_blank">stance detection in German</a>, with <a href="https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/people/team/compling/klenner.html" target="_blank">Manfred Klenner</a> as my supervisor. My general NLP interests include sentiment analysis (e.g. hate speech detection), coreference resolution, and machine translation.<br>

I'm originally from Los Angeles and spent nine years in the San Francisco Bay Area before moving to Zurich. I often miss the beach, though snow has grown on me during my time here.<br>

Outside of NLP, I'm passionate about mental healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights, veganism, and sustainable fashion. I enjoy solo traveling, taking long walks, going to the movies, and making Korean food for friends.<br>

Lastly, I prefer Coop to Migros. But neither compares to <a href="https://g.page/BerkeleyBowlMarketplace?share" target="_blank">Berkeley Bowl</a>.<br>
