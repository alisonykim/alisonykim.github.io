<p>
I am a Master's student of (Digital) Linguistics at the University of Zurich. Currently, I'm part of a team working on <a href="https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en/texttechnologies/research/opinionmining/sentiment-inference.html" target="_blank">stance detection in German</a>, with <a href="https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/people/team/compling/klenner.html" target="_blank">Manfred Klenner</a> as my supervisor. My general research interests include sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and coreference resolution.<br><br>

Originally, I'm from Los Angeles, California. I often miss the beach, though snow has grown on me during my time in Switzerland.<br><br>

Outside of computational linguistics, I am passionate about mental healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights, veganism, and sustainable fashion. I enjoy traveling solo, taking long walks, going to the movies, and making Korean food for friends. I'm also a huge fan of the Swiss Federal Railways.<br><br>

Lastly, I prefer Coop to Migros. But neither compares to <a href="https://g.page/BerkeleyBowlMarketplace?share" target="_blank">Berkeley Bowl</a>.<br>
