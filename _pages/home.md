Computational linguistics is a beautiful intersection of informatics and the most extraordinary human phenomenon: language.<br><br>

With both skills and enthusiasm for NLP — particularly language modeling, text generation, and sentiment analysis — I have honed my expertise in developing high-performing NLP models and solutions. As a recent Master’s graduate, I am excited to apply my NLP and ML skills to large-scale challenges in highly relevant industries like legal tech, finance, insurance, and healthcare and pharma.
