Hi there! I am a fourth semester M.A. student of digital linguistics at the University of Zurich (UZH). For my thesis on decoding strategies for NLG, I am co-advised by <a href="https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/people/team/compling/mmueller.html" target="_blank">Mathias Müller</a> (UZH), <a href="https://rycolab.io/" target="_blank">Ryan Cotterell</a> (ETH), and <a href="https://cimeister.github.io/" target="_blank">Clara Meister</a> (ETH). Additionally, I work on a <a href="https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en/texttechnologies/research/opinionmining/sentiment-inference.html" target="_blank">German-language stance detection</a> project led by <a href="https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/people/team/compling/klenner.html" target="_blank">Manfred Klenner</a>. <br><br>

I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. I miss its beaches and tacos, though snow and bürli have grown on me during my time in Switzerland.<br><br>

Outside of language, I'm passionate about mental healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights, veganism, and sustainable fashion. I'm also a huge fan of the Swiss Federal Railways and can be found coding or reading from time to time in what I call my "train office".<br><br>

Lastly, I prefer Coop to Migros. But neither will ever compare to <a href="https://g.page/BerkeleyBowlMarketplace?share" target="_blank">Berkeley Bowl</a>.<br>
