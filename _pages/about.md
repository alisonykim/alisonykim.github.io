I recently finished the first year of my M.A. in (Digital) Linguistics at the University of Zurich. Currently, I'm part of a team working on [stance detection in German](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en/texttechnologies/research/opinionmining/sentiment-inference.html){:target="\_blank"}, with [Manfred Klenner](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/people/team/compling/klenner.html){:target="\_blank"} as my supervisor. My general NLP interests include sentiment analysis (e.g. hate speech detection), coreference resolution, and machine translation.

I'm originally from Los Angeles and spent nine years in the San Francisco Bay Area before moving to Zurich. I often miss the beach, though snow has grown on me during my time here.

Outside of NLP, I'm passionate about mental healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights, veganism, and sustainable fashion. I enjoy solo traveling, taking long walks, going to the movies, and making Korean food for friends.

Lastly, I prefer Coop to Migros. But neither compares to [Berkeley Bowl](https://g.page/BerkeleyBowlMarketplace?share){:target="\_blank"}.
