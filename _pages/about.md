I recently finished the first year of my M.A. in Digital Linguistics at the [University of Zurich](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en.html). Currently, I'm part of a team led by [Manfred Klenner](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/people/team/compling/klenner.html) that researches [stance detection in German](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en/texttechnologies/research/opinionmining/sentiment-inference.html).

I'm a Los Angeles native with Korean roots. After nine years in the San Francisco Bay Area, I moved to Zurich to start my education in computational linguistics. Yes, I miss regular sunlight and warm beaches, though snow has grown on me during my time here.

In my free time, I enjoy taking solo trips, making Korean food for friends, watching movies in theaters, and raving about the SBB (Swiss Federal Railways). Outside of NLP, I'm passionate about mental health, LGBTQ+ activism, veganism, and sustainable fashion.

Lastly, I prefer Coop to Migros. But neither compares to [Berkeley Bowl](https://g.page/BerkeleyBowlMarketplace?share).
