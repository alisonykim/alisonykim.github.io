I recently finished the first year of my M.A. in Digital Linguistics at the [University of Zurich](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en.html). Currently, I'm currently part of a team, led by [Manfred Klenner](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/people/team/compling/klenner.html), that works on [stance detection in German](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en/texttechnologies/research/opinionmining/sentiment-inference.html). My general NLP interests include sentiment analysis (e.g. hate speech detection), coreference resolution, and machine translation.

Originally, I grew up in Los Angeles and spent nine years in the San Francisco Bay Area before moving to Zurich. I often miss the beach, though snow has grown on me during my time here.

In my free time, I enjoy taking solo trips, going to the movies, making Korean food for friends, and raving about the SBB (Swiss Federal Railways). Outside of NLP, I'm passionate about mental health, LGBTQ+ activism, veganism, and sustainable fashion.

Lastly, I prefer Coop to Migros. But neither compares to [Berkeley Bowl](https://g.page/BerkeleyBowlMarketplace?share).
