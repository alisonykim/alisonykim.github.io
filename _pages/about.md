Hi!

I recently finished the first year of my M.A. in Digital Linguistics at the University of Zurich. Currently, I work in [Manfred Klenner](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/people/team/compling/klenner.html)'s group on a project focused on [stance detection in German](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en/texttechnologies/research/opinionmining/sentiment-inference.html).

Originally, I grew up in Los Angeles and spent nine years in the San Francisco Bay Area before moving to Zurich. Yes, I miss regular sunlight and warm beaches, though snow has grown on me during my time here.

In my free time, I enjoy taking solo trips, making Korean food for friends, attending film festivals and live music, and raving about the SBB (Swiss Federal Railways). Outside of NLP, I'm passionate about mental health, LGBTQ+ activism, veganism, and sustainable fashion.

Lastly, I prefer Coop to Migros. But neither compares to [Berkeley Bowl](https://g.page/BerkeleyBowlMarketplace?share).
